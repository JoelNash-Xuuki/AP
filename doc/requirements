- Build with Python 3.7
- Use NumPy, panda, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- App runs withn anaconda environment usng a jupyter notebook.
- No concurrent parts, do not use python threads.
- Cleaning and prepare a data set

  * Extract each 'type' of airport into its own column that are:
	- large_airport
	- medium_airport 
	- small_airport
  * Match each airport in all catagories with its communication 
	frequency 'frequency_mhz'.
		
  * remove data that have 'type''closed'
- Load data set
- Translate data set into suitable format (XML or JSON).
  * have reasons that are distinct advantages and minimal limitations over
	other data formats.
- Produce a model that shows how the data needs to be restructred taking 
  advantage of the selected format.
- means to backup data selected format using files or db. 
- Produce mean,mode and median 'frequency_mhz' for each 'large_airport'.
- Produce mean,mode and median 'frequency_mhz' for each frequencies >100mhz.
- Produce a graph that displays communication frequencies of 'small_airport'
- Is there a correlation between the communication frequencies used by 3
  different categories.
- 'Are some frequencies user more that others?'
- Week2, Production 1: Data translation for storage.
- Produce 200-word relection stating:
  * reason for your format
  * advantages for the format 
  * limitations on future use of this data on this format.
  * literature that supports decision.
